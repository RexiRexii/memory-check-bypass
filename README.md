# Memory check crippler-inator
UD*

# How to use
Simply import the files within the repository (utilities and integrity_check), include the integrity_check.hpp into your dllmain. Afterwards declare a variable (an example is located in dllmain.cpp) and call initialize_bypass()

# What if I don't want to make a new project
We have compiled it for you and put it into Releases section! So that you'll only have to inject it.
