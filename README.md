# Memory check crippler-inator

# How to use
Simply import the files within the repository (utilities and integrity_check), include the integrity_check.hpp into your dllmain. Afterwards declare a variable (an example is located in dllmain.cpp) and call initialize_bypass()

I will throw in a better documentation soon
